During the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase, we identified several interesting insights:

• The distribution plot revealed that the majority of purchase leads fall within the range of 200 to 400.

• Australia recorded the highest purchase leads, followed by Malaysia in second place.

• Only 15% of the leads resulted in ticket bookings, indicating that 85% did not convert.

• Countries like Jordan and New Zealand had a higher average flight duration than others.

• The pie chart showed that 92% of bookings were completed through the Internet, while 8% were completed via mobile devices.


About the ML Modeling:

• Firstly, we utilized the label encoder to convert categorical columns into numerical values, enabling us to work with these features in our machine-learning models.

• Next, we divided the data into independent and dependent variables. To ensure uniformity in the data, we applied normalization techniques.
Subsequently, we split the data into training and testing sets, reserving 25% of the data for testing purposes, thus allowing us to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

• We then proceeded to create a function for machine learning modeling. With this function, we could apply various classification algorithms to the data and compare their performance to determine the most suitable model for our task.


Finally about the project:

Some interesting insights are observed in the dataset. It appears that the majority of people, approximately 91%, did not book their tickets, while only 9% of the people showed interest in booking. This highlights the need to enhance the quality of extra services such as luggage handling, specific seat selection, and meal options, as these factors seem to have a significant impact on customers' decisions. Additionally, we could consider incorporating online advertisements to attract more bookings.
